#
#   --show-completion               Show completion for the current shell,
#                                   to copy it or customize the

# poetry run palindromechecker --word civic --approach recursive

# âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

# ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "civic" is a palindrome!

# ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
